# React Sample Project

A sample React project to demonstrate the skills outlined in the [rubric](https://projects.kenzan.com/confluence/display/KTS/React.js).

A [live demo](https://derrikcurran-kenzan.github.io/react-sample) is available.

## Notes For Tech Radar Reviewer

The React page on Tech Radar hasn't been filled in yet so I used the [rubric](https://projects.kenzan.com/confluence/display/KTS/React.js) on Confluence.

The code that matters for the review can be found in [src/Parent.js](https://github.com/derrikcurran-kenzan/react-sample/blob/master/src/Parent.js) and [src/Child.js](https://github.com/derrikcurran-kenzan/react-sample/blob/master/src/Child.js).

This project was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Dev

```
npm i
npm start
```

## Production

Run `npm run deploy` to build for production and deploy to GitHub Pages.
